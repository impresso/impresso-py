# Result object

When you execute a query, a `DataContainer` object is returned. This object encapsulates the query results along with metadata about the query. Additionally, it provides a suite of utility methods for accessing the results in various ways.

In a Python notebook environment, the `DataContainer` object can render a preview of its data, facilitating quick inspection of the query results.
