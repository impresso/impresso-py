# Result object

Every time you run a query, you get a `DataContainer` object. This object contains the results of the query and some metadata about the query. It also contains a collection of utility methods that you can use to access the result in different ways.

When the `DataContainer` object is used in a Python notebook environment, it can render itself as a preview of the data it contains. This is useful for quickly inspecting the results of a query.
