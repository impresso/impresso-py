Impresso is a library to interact with the [Impresso](https://impresso-project.ch/app) dataset. It provides a set of classes to interact with the API and a set of tools that make working with the data easier.

## Installation and prerequisites

The Impresso python library can be installed using `pip`:

```shell
pip install impresso
```

The library requires Python version `3.10` as a minimum. It has a number of dependencies that are likely already present in a Jupyter environment like `matplotlib` and `pandas`.
